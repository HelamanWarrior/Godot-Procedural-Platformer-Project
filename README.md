# Procedural Platformer Starter Project

This project uses Godot 3.0. Although it can be modified to work in 4.0, the current state of the project isn't built for it.

This is an example of the same system used in one of my games.

Please note this project is barebones and doesn't come with all the extra features you may see above.

You can follow along with the tutorials [on YouTube here.](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6bQeQE-ybqAs47G_y32-zah0ieGLzgve)
The tutorial is pretty old and crappy, but if you wanna follow along with me programming you can watch it.
